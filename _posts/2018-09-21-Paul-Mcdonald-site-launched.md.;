Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.
I am liking class so far it is fun and very hands on and I really like hands on learning. We have been learning about how to create a website
