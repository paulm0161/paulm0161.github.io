#`I am doing the australian flag My flag has no gemoetry that I could find on the website but I just chose my own geometry.My flag has a blue base and in and has the union jack in the top left corner and has three 8 point stars on the flag  
# Why does my flag have no geometry? And can I continue using my own geometry like I have been using. I have been strugling to find a good size so I can fit the union jack in my flag and the stars were very hard to cut out.
