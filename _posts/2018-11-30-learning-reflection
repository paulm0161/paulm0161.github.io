The question I chose is question 3. The question is asking for you to find the third argument of the inermost function of 
(scale2 2 (circle 40 "solid" "blue")). The correct answer would be D "blue". The answer is blue because it is in the innmermost
function which means it is in the inner () and it is the 3rd arguement 40,"solid","blue". The second most choosen answer is C
"solid" because the people may have thought circle was an arguement and thought it was circle,40,"solid" which it is not.
